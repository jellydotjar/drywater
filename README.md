# Hello!
and thank you for downloading my map!
First things first there are two verisons, one that has nature sounds and one that has elevator music, if you want the music install bg_drywater_music instead
Secondly this is a BACKGROUND MAP ONLY, meaning its only use is for playing in the background of your main menu
Lastly you can do 

map_background bg_drywater

or if you have the music one

map_background bg_drywater_music

You can add these to your autoexec to save time.
